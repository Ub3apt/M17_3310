# M17_3310
Mainboard replacement for Nokia 3310

## Photos
Both photos in the `misc` directory are cropped, so that if you scale them for 108mm height, you should be able to make direct measurements using GIMP or other image editing software.

## Firmware
See the example firmware [here](https://github.com/M17-Project/M17_3310-fw).
